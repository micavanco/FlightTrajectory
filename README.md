# FlightTrajectory

Qt application written in C++ to simulate trajectory and to measure time to apogee of vertically shooted out bullets. Algorithm detect the highest peak of object trajectory and send actuall time data to user interface. Trajectory is calculated based on time from started measurment and maximum reached height of bullet.
